# KINJ (KINJ Is Not JDBC)

This project aims at transpiling the querying to the KnoBAB server for many programming languages as possible.

In order to do so, you need to install [Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) first. After this, you can generate the C#, Java, and Python3 clients for KnoBAB by running the ```compile_to_languages.sh``` script.
